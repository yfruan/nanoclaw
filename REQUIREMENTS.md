# NanoClaw Requirements

Original requirements and design decisions from the project creator.

## Vision

A personal Claude assistant accessible via WhatsApp, with minimal custom code.

**Core components:**
- **Claude Agent SDK** as the core agent
- **Apple Container** for isolated agent execution (Linux VMs)
- **WhatsApp** as the primary I/O channel
- **Persistent memory** per conversation and globally
- **Scheduled tasks** that run Claude and can message back
- **Web access** for search and browsing
- **Browser automation** via agent-browser

**Design philosophy:**
- Leverage existing tools (WhatsApp connector, Claude Agent SDK, MCP servers)
- Minimal glue code
- File-based systems where possible (CLAUDE.md for memory, folders for groups)

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Message Routing
- A router listens to WhatsApp and routes messages based on configuration
- Only messages from registered groups are processed
- Trigger: `@Andy` prefix (case insensitive), configurable via `ASSISTANT_NAME` env var
- Unregistered groups are ignored completely

### Memory System
- **Per-group memory**: Each group has a folder with its own `CLAUDE.md`
- **Global memory**: Root `CLAUDE.md` is read by all groups, but only writable from "main" (self-chat)
- **Files**: Groups can create/read files in their folder and reference them
- Agent runs in the group's folder, automatically inherits both CLAUDE.md files

### Session Management
- Each group maintains a conversation session (via Claude Agent SDK)
- `/clear` command resets the session but keeps memory files
- Old session IDs are archived to a file

### Container Isolation
- All agents run inside Apple Container (lightweight Linux VMs)
- Each agent invocation spawns a container with mounted directories
- Containers provide filesystem isolation - agents can only see mounted paths
- Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on the host
- Browser automation via agent-browser with Chromium in the container

### Scheduled Tasks
- Users can ask Claude to schedule recurring or one-time tasks from any group
- Tasks run as full agents in the context of the group that created them
- Tasks have access to all tools including Bash (safe in container)
- Tasks can optionally send messages to their group via `send_message` tool, or complete silently
- Task runs are logged to the database with duration and result
- Schedule types: cron expressions, intervals (ms), or one-time (ISO timestamp)
- From main: can schedule tasks for any group, view/manage all tasks
- From other groups: can only manage that group's tasks

### Group Management
- New groups are added explicitly via the main channel
- Groups are registered by editing `data/registered_groups.json`
- Each group gets a dedicated folder under `groups/`
- Groups can have additional directories mounted via `containerConfig`

### Main Channel Privileges
- Main channel is the admin/control group (typically self-chat)
- Can write to global memory (`groups/CLAUDE.md`)
- Can schedule tasks for any group
- Can view and manage tasks from all groups
- Can configure additional directory mounts for any group

## Integration Points

### WhatsApp
- Using baileys library for WhatsApp Web connection
- Messages stored in SQLite, polled by router
- QR code authentication during setup

### Email (Gmail)
- Read-only MCP integration (can read and send, but not an I/O channel)
- Optional, enabled during setup

### Scheduler
- Built-in scheduler runs on the host, spawns containers for task execution
- Custom `nanoclaw` MCP server (inside container) provides scheduling tools
- Tools: `schedule_task`, `list_tasks`, `pause_task`, `resume_task`, `cancel_task`, `send_message`
- Tasks stored in SQLite with run history
- Scheduler loop checks for due tasks every minute
- Tasks execute Claude Agent SDK in containerized group context

### Web Access
- Built-in WebSearch and WebFetch tools
- Standard Claude Agent SDK capabilities

### Browser Automation
- agent-browser CLI with Chromium in container
- Snapshot-based interaction with element references (@e1, @e2, etc.)
- Screenshots, PDFs, video recording
- Authentication state persistence

---

## Setup & Customization

### Philosophy
- Minimal configuration files
- Setup and customization done via Claude Code
- Users clone the repo and run Claude Code to configure
- Each user gets a custom setup matching their exact needs

### Skills
- `/setup` - Install dependencies, authenticate WhatsApp/Gmail, configure scheduler, start services
- `/customize` - General-purpose skill for adding capabilities (new channels like Telegram, new integrations, behavior changes)

### Deployment
- Runs on local Mac via launchd
- Single Node.js process handles everything

## Personal Configuration (Reference)

These are the creator's settings, stored here for reference:

- **Trigger**: `@Andy` (case insensitive)
- **Response prefix**: `Andy:`
- **Persona**: Default Claude (no custom personality)
- **Gmail**: Enabled
- **Main channel**: Self-chat (messaging yourself in WhatsApp)

## Project Name

**NanoClaw** - A reference to Clawdbot (now OpenClaw).
